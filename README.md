CMake Conditionals
============

This exploring conditionals in CMake and using cmake-gui this does
not actually build/generate anything. And is based on
(CMake blog post 82)[http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/82].


Instructions:
```
mkdir -p cmake-conditionals
cd cmake-conditionals
git clone https://github.com/winksaville/cmake-conditionals.git
mkdir build
cd build
rm -rf * ; cmake-gui ..
```
